(** [month d] is [d]'s month (1--12). *)

(** [day d] is [d]'s day of the month (1--31). *)

val compare : t -> t -> int
(** [compare d0 d1] is a total order on dates, ordered chronologically. *)

(** [equal d0 d1] is [true] iff [d0] and [d1] represent the same date. *)

(** [d0 > d1] is [true] iff [d0] is strictly after [d1]. *)
